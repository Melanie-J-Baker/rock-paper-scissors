# rock-paper-scissors

My first JavaScript project, created as part of the Odin Project curriculum: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors

Play the game here:

Game is played against the computer which picks a random answer. The game keeps track of scores and is played round by round for 5 rounds. You will write a function named playGame that calls playRound to play 5 rounds, keeps track of the scores and declares a winner at the end.
